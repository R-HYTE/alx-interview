# Minimum Operations Calculator

## Introduction
This project contains a Python script that demonstrates a computational approach to solving the problem of determining the minimum number of "Copy All" and "Paste" operations required to achieve a specified number of 'H' characters in a text editor, starting from a single 'H'. The script applies fundamental concepts of number factorization and optimizes operations through strategic grouping.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to introduce and reinforce understanding in the following areas:

- **Algorithm Design**: Learn how to approach and solve a problem efficiently using mathematical principles.
- **Prime Factorization**: Understand the role of factorization in algorithm design and how it can be used to simplify and optimize solutions.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Develop skills in identifying and applying efficient methods to reduce computational complexity.
- **Programming Practices**: Gain experience in writing clean, well-documented Python code.

## Functionality
The core of this project lies in the `minOperations(n)` function, which:
- Takes an integer `n`, the target number of 'H' characters.
- Returns the minimum number of operations needed to reach exactly `n` 'H' characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste".

### Example Use Case
If you want to achieve 12 'H' characters, starting from 1, the function will return `7` as the minimum number of operations required.

## How It Works
The function uses a systematic approach to break down the target number `n` into its prime factors, using these factors to determine the sequence and frequency of operations. Here's the step-by-step methodology:
1. Start with the smallest possible factor.
2. For each factor, determine how many times you can use "Copy All" followed by multiple "Paste" operations to contribute to building up to `n`.
3. Continue this until all factors are used up or until the remaining number is a prime that can't be reduced further.
