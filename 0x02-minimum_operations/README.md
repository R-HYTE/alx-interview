# Minimum Operations Calculator

## Introduction
This project contains a Python script that demonstrates a computational approach to solving the problem of determining the minimum number of "Copy All" and "Paste" operations required to achieve a specified number of 'H' characters in a text editor, starting from a single 'H'. The script applies fundamental concepts of number factorization and optimizes operations through strategic grouping.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to introduce and reinforce understanding in the following areas:

- **Algorithm Design**: Learn how to approach and solve a problem efficiently using mathematical principles.
- **Prime Factorization**: Understand the role of factorization in algorithm design and how it can be used to simplify and optimize solutions.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Develop skills in identifying and applying efficient methods to reduce computational complexity.
- **Programming Practices**: Gain experience in writing clean, well-documented Python code.

## Functionality
The core of this project lies in the `minOperations(n)` function, which:
- Takes an integer `n`, the target number of 'H' characters.
- Returns the minimum number of operations needed to reach exactly `n` 'H' characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste".

### Example Use Case
If you want to achieve 12 'H' characters, starting from 1, the function will return `7` as the minimum number of operations required.

## How It Works
The function uses a systematic approach to break down the target number `n` into its prime factors, using these factors to determine the sequence and frequency of operations. Here's the step-by-step methodology:
1. Start with the smallest possible factor.
2. For each factor, determine how many times you can use "Copy All" followed by multiple "Paste" operations to contribute to building up to `n`.
3. Continue this until all factors are used up or until the remaining number is a prime that can't be reduced further.

## Example Illustration: Calculating Minimum Operations for 12 'H's

This section provides a simple illustration of how the `minOperations` function calculates the minimum number of "Copy All" and "Paste" operations needed to achieve a specified number of 'H' characters, starting from a single 'H'. Here, we will consider the case where `n = 12`.

### Factorization Process and Operation Calculation

- **Start with n = 12**.
  - **Check factor = 2** (smallest prime factor):
    - 12 is divisible by 2.
    - **Perform Operation**: Add 2 to operations (1 copy + 1 paste).
    - **Operations so far**: 2.
    - **Update n**: Divide n by 2 → n becomes 6.
    - 6 is still divisible by 2.
    - **Perform Operation**: Add 2 to operations (1 copy + 1 paste).
    - **Operations so far**: 4.
    - **Update n**: Divide n by 2 → n becomes 3.
  - **Check factor = 3**:
    - 3 is divisible by 3.
    - **Perform Operation**: Add 3 to operations (1 copy + 2 pastes).
    - **Operations so far**: 7.
    - **Update n**: Divide n by 3 → n becomes 1.

- **Conclusion**:
  - As n is now 1, all factors have been fully applied.
  - The **minimum number of operations** to reach 12 'H's from a single 'H' is **7**.
