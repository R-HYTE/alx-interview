# UTF-8 Encoding Validation Function

## Overview

This Python module contains a function `validUTF8(data)` designed to validate whether a given list of integers represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters defined by Unicode.

## Function Description

The function `validUTF8(data)` takes a list `data` where each element represents a byte (0 <= x <= 255). It iterates through the list to check if the sequence of bytes conforms to the rules of UTF-8 encoding:

- It uses bitwise operations to inspect each byte and determine its type (starting byte, continuation byte, or invalid byte).
- The function ensures that each byte sequence matches the expected UTF-8 format:
  - Starting bytes are identified by specific leading bits.
  - Continuation bytes follow a distinct pattern.
- If the sequence of bytes conforms to these rules, the function returns `True`, indicating a valid UTF-8 encoding.
- If any byte does not match the expected format or if the sequence is incomplete, the function returns `False`.

## Usage

To use the `validUTF8` function, import the module and call `validUTF8(data)` with a list of integers representing the bytes of a potential UTF-8 encoded data set.

Example usage:
```python
from utf8_validation import validUTF8

data = [197, 130, 1]  # Example list representing UTF-8 encoded bytes
result = validUTF8(data)

if result:
    print("The data is a valid UTF-8 encoding.")
else:
    print("The data is not a valid UTF-8 encoding.")
```

## Notes
- Ensure that the input `data` only contains integers within the range 0 to 255.
- The function assumes the input data represents a complete UTF-8 encoded sequence; partial sequences may not yield accurate results.
