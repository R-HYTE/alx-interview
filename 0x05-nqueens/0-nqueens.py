N Queens Puzzle Solver

This module provides a solution to the N Queens puzzle, which is the challenge
of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. It uses a backtracking
algorithm to find all possible solutions.

Usage:
    python nqueens.py N

Where:
    N must be an integer greater than or equal to 4.

If the user calls the program with the wrong number of arguments, prints:
    Usage: nqueens N

If N is not an integer, prints:
    N must be a number

If N is smaller than 4, prints:
    N must be at least 4

The program prints every possible solution to the problem,
one solution per line.
Each solution is represented as a list of pairs [i, j], where i and j are the
row and column indices of a queen on the board.
