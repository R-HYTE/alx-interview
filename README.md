# Mock Interview Question Solutions Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to the Mock Interview Question Solutions Repository! This repository is dedicated to those preparing for software engineering interviews, especially focusing on enhancing problem-solving abilities. Each directory within this repository contains solutions to common and complex interview questions, demonstrated through well-documented Python scripts.

## Objective
The primary goal of this repository is to provide hands-on practice with a variety of programming challenges that mimic real interview questions. By working through these problems, you can:

- **Improve Problem-Solving Skills**: Enhance your ability to tackle unfamiliar problems under interview-like conditions.
- **Learn Efficient Coding Techniques**: Discover and apply optimal coding practices and algorithms.
- **Prepare for Technical Interviews**: Build confidence by familiarizing yourself with the types and formats of questions typically asked in technical interviews.

## Repository Structure
Each directory in the repository focuses on a particular set of problems or a specific topic, exemplified by:
- **Algorithm Efficiency**
- **Data Structures**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Mathematical Problems** (e.g., the `minOperations` script in this directory)

### Featured Scripts
- **`0-pascal_triangle.py`**: This script generates Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows. Pascalâ€™s triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients and has applications in algebra, probability, and combinatorics. This function helps in understanding how dynamic programming can be applied to compute values iteratively.

- **`0-lockboxes.py`**: Implements a method to determine if all boxes can be opened where each box contains a set of keys that may unlock other boxes. This script utilizes a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to efficiently explore and unlock all possible boxes, demonstrating practical graph traversal techniques.

- **`0-minoperations.py`**: Demonstrates the application of prime factorization to solve an optimization problem, namely minimizing the number of operations needed to multiply the count of a single character in a text file.

## How to Use This Repository
To make the most out of this repository:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate through the directories to find problems of interest.
3. Study the provided solutions and attempt to solve the problems on your own before reviewing the solutions.
4. Modify the scripts to try out different approaches or optimize the existing solutions.
